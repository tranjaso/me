TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I learnt how to create, clone and fork repositories. I understood the difference between cloning and forking and its reason. By forking we essentially give ourselves permission to edit/modify files while cloning is to grab the file from the original source itself. The reason why we do that is so that we don't have an outdated version. 

 What I found unclear was the best way to solve problems, for example we could commit and push our changes into vscode, but we could also write a command in the terminal to do it. I found it hard to follow the test cases on vscode, and random symbols that are there but shouldn't(?) be.

E.g Below as shown from what I found in the testcases, I didn't understand what this was.

Problems I encountered after pushing the file 'aboutMe.yml' was that the website was being 'ratelimited' (high traffic overloading the website), which means I wasn't able to check if my info has shown up on the front page.

What I'm going to do after class is to make sure my info is correct, also for things I found confusing I will make sure to make use of websites such as stack overflow to find solutions.

TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Exercise0: For shout_with_a_number, I realised that I couldn’t call the shout() function with 2 arguments as shout() could only take in 1 positional argument. The solution I found was to call in these variables separately - instead of shout(a_string, a_number) which wasn’t allowed I did a_string.upper() + a_number. There was another problem with this, as a_number is defined as an integer, I wasn’t able to concatenate it with a_string. A fix for this was to format a_number from an integer to a string by using str(a_number).  I also realised I had to have a space in between otherwise it would be a_stringa_number instead of a_string a_number. Therefore I solved this with “ “. 

The result was the_answer = a_string.upper() + “ “ + str(a_number). Another way I think I could’ve done this was the_answer = shout(a_string) + “ “ + str(a_number). 

Exercise1: This set of exercises helped me learn and understand how to interpret code. It was really helpful as it allowed me to research types of documentation of python code, helping me understand the language and reason as to what each bit of code does. What helped me overall in this step was running the code and seeing what it did.

Exercise2: Basically, through trial and error I was able to debug the code by continuously running the program. This allowed me to see what was wrong. By solving the typos, I managed to get this program to run and print out MC Hammer!

Exercise 3: I found these sets of exercises very challenging, especially when I was doing loops_2 and the last two questions. 

Not sure how to do loops_7, will go through it soon.
